The first alpha release of pyAttachSQL and pyAttachDB has been released today.  pyAttachSQL is a Python wrapper for libAttachSQL and pyAttachDB is a DB API 2.0 connector which uses pyAttachSQL underneath.

At the moment pyAttachSQL requires a preview build of libAttachSQL 2.0.  Therefore there is a PPA to install both the required preview build and pyAttachSQL.  This is currently for Ubuntu 12.04 (Precise) only and is available at `the libAttachSQL dev PPA <https://launchpad.net/~linuxjedi/+archive/ubuntu/libattachsql-dev/>`_.

The source is available `on GitHub <https://github.com/libattachsql/pyattachsql>`_ and the documentation `on Read The Docs <http://pyattachsql.readthedocs.org/>`_.

Later versions will be available for more platforms, especially as libAttachSQL 2.0 nears release.  Watch this space!
